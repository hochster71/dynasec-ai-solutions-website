            <h3>⚓ Founder's Statement</h3>
            <p>I served this country for over three decades — from E-1 to LCDR — through every battle group, threat vector, and technological evolution. Dynasec is the continuation of that mission: to defend, innovate, and win through AI. We don’t build software. We build dominance. — <strong>Michael B. Hoch</strong></p>

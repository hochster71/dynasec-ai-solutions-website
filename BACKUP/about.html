    <h2>üß≠ Our Origin Story</h2>
    <p>DYNASEC AI SOLUTIONS was forged from over three decades of elite military leadership, cybersecurity dominance, and uncompromising operational command. Founded by Lieutenant Commander (Ret.) Michael Hoch, a U.S. Navy Mustang who rose from E-1 to O-4, this empire was not born in a tech incubator ‚Äî it was forged in combat information centers, tactical war rooms, and the cyber battlespace.</p>
    <p>Our founder‚Äôs legacy includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>31 years of U.S. Navy service, concluding as the Lead Exercise and War Games Officer and Cybersecurity Lead for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)</li>

      <li>Deep-rooted expertise in RMF, ATO, CMMC 2.0, POA&M development, and Zero Trust Architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DYNASEC AI SOLUTIONS is not a product company. It is a global command empire built on trust, compliance, warfighting excellence, and AI innovation.</p>
